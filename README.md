# MongoDBRelationShipUsingMongoose
RelationShip between schema in MongoDB
In this code , i have just tried to create relation between two schema and use Populate method to find the result.
After cloning the code , make sure you change the connectiun string to your specific mongoDb server.
Do install mongoose locally.
npm install mongoose --save is the command.
